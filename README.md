# Usage

## Train By Images

- Fill `datasets/imgs/ok` and `datasets/imgs/not_ok` with the according images.
- Run `convert_imgs_to_data.py` in order to generate the hand landmarks at `datasets/data`.
- Eventually, run `train.py`, the model will be available at `model.pickle`.

## Train By Videos

- Fill `datasets/vids/ok` and `datasets/vids/not_ok` with the according videos.
- Run `convert_vidss_to_data.py` in order to generate the hand landmarks at `datasets/data`.
- Eventually, run `train.py`, the model will be available at `model.pickle`.
